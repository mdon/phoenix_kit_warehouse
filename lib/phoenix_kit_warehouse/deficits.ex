defmodule PhoenixKitWarehouse.Deficits do
  @moduledoc """
  Context for computing per-item stock deficits (§5, full variant).

  Combines three existing signals — current on-hand stock
  (`StockLedger.stock_map/0`), how much of that stock is reserved by posted
  internal orders (`reserved_by_item/0`), and the configured per-item
  minimum (`MinStockSettings.min_stock_map/0`) — into "how much is actually
  available" and "which items have fallen below their minimum".

  Wave-1 limitations (see `dev_docs/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md`):
    - The minimum stock threshold is global per item, not per
      `{item_uuid, location_uuid}` pair — `available_by_item/0` sums on-hand
      quantity across every warehouse (via `StockLedger.stock_map/0`).
    - Neither `reserved_by_item/0` nor `available_by_item/0` see stock "in
      transit" on an unfinished (`in_transit`) `Transfer` — it has already
      left the source warehouse's `Stock` row but hasn't yet landed on the
      destination's, so it's invisible to both. Not compensated for here —
      the same limitation is noted on `PhoenixKitWarehouse.Turnover` and
      `Web.StockLive`.

  @doc """
  Returns `%{item_uuid => Decimal}` — the quantity currently reserved
  against each item by posted internal orders.

  Only `status == "posted"` internal orders reserve stock
  (`InternalOrders.list_posted_internal_orders/0` already filters for this
  in SQL) — drafts are unconfirmed proposals and reserve nothing, otherwise
  every draft would manufacture a false deficit.

  For each posted order, each line's reservation is
  `max(0, required_quantity - already_issued)`, where `already_issued` is
  how much of *that order's own* `required_quantity` has already shipped out
  via a **posted** Goods Issue referencing it (via
  `CommittedQuantities.compute/5`, `status: "posted"` — a draft Goods Issue
  hasn't decremented stock yet, so it must not shrink the reservation early;
  doing so would let `available_by_item/0` overstate what's actually free).
  This is computed **per line, per order**, then summed by `item_uuid`
  across every order — deliberately not as a single global
  `Σrequired - Σissued` per item. The per-order clamp to zero matters:
  without it, fully (or over-) issuing one internal order could drive that
  order's own line negative, which would then wrongly cancel out a
  different internal order's still-open reservation for the same item once
  summed globally.
